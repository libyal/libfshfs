To do:
* complete name case folding and decomposition tests
* add support for resource fork data stream
* add support for extended attribute (named fork) data stream
* on file_entry_initialize lookup com.apple.decmpfs specifically instead of all attributes?
* catalog B-tree file, include name in branch key check
* file entry API: add extents functions

* check flags to see if file entry has extended attributes

* look at how case folding is stored

* ensure traditional HFS input errors for now

* add support to print information about special files (those without a catalog record)

* what about a directory with extended attributes?
** what if that attribute is named com.apple.decmpfs ?
* what about a symbolic link to HFS+ Private data directory?

Format support:
* implement support for traditional HFS
* implement support for HFS+/HFX Unicode 2.1 version
* implement support for folder and file information
* implement support for extended folder and file information
